Problem
For two strings s1 and s2 of equal length, the p-distance between them, denoted dp(s1,s2), is the
proportion of corresponding symbols that differ between s1 and s2.

For a general distance function d on n taxa s1,s2,…,sn (taxa are often represented by genetic strings),
 we may encode the distances between pairs of taxa via a distance matrix D in which Di,j=d(si,sj).

Given: A collection of n (n≤10) DNA strings s1,…,sn of equal length (at most 1 kbp). Strings are given
in FASTA format.

Return: The matrix D corresponding to the p-distance dp on the given strings. As always, note that
your answer is allowed an absolute error of 0.001.
